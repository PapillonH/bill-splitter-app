# bill-splitter-app

## Overview
The Bill Splitter App is designed to make splitting bills in large group dining scenarios easier and more accurate. It helps users avoid common issues like restaurants miscounting bills and the hassle of manually splitting and collecting money from multiple people. The app streamlines the process by allowing users to input bills, assign items to individuals, and calculate each person's fair share.

## Features
- **Easy Bill Entry**: Users can input the total bill and itemized costs.
- **Item Assignment**: Assign specific items to individuals for accurate cost calculation.
- **Tax & Tip Calculation**: Automatically distributes tax and tip based on individual item costs.
- **Group Payment Tracking**: Keeps track of who has paid and how much each person owes.
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Supports cash, card, and digital payments.
- **Receipt Scanning (Future Feature)**: Extracts bill details using OCR.
- **Integration with Payment Apps (Future Feature)**: Allows users to send and receive payments directly within the app.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (with Tailwind CSS for styling)
- **Backend**: TBD (options include Node.js with Express, Firebase, or a serverless backend)
- **Database**: TBD (Firestore, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL)
- **OCR (Future Feature)**: Tesseract.js or a cloud-based OCR API

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bill-splitter-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd bill-splitter-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Create a new bill and enter the total amount.
3. Assign items to individuals.
4. Review and confirm each person's share.
5. Track payments and settle outstanding balances.

## Roadmap
- Implement receipt scanning with OCR.
- Add integration with digital payment platforms like PayPal, Venmo, or Interac e-Transfer.
- Introduce a user authentication system for saving and sharing bills.
- Improve UI/UX for a seamless user experience.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
