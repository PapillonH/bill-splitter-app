# bill-splitter-app

## Overview
The Bill Splitter App is designed to make splitting bills in large group dining scenarios easier and more accurate. It helps users avoid common issues like restaurants miscounting bills and the hassle of manually splitting and collecting money from multiple people. The app streamlines the process by allowing users to input bills, assign items to individuals, and calculate each person's fair share.

## Features
- **Easy Bill Entry**: Users can input the total bill and itemized costs.
- **Item Assignment**: Assign specific items to individuals for accurate cost calculation.
- **Tax & Tip Calculation**: Automatically distributes tax and tip based on individual item costs.
- **Group Payment Tracking**: Keeps track of who has paid and how much each person owes.
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Supports cash, card, and digital payments.
- **Receipt Scanning (Future Feature)**: Extracts bill details using OCR.
- **Integration with Payment Apps (Future Feature)**: Allows users to send and receive payments directly within the app.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (with Tailwind CSS for styling)
- **Backend**: TBD (options include Node.js with Express, Firebase, or a serverless backend)
- **Database**: TBD (Firestore, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL)
- **OCR (Future Feature)**: Tesseract.js or a cloud-based OCR API
